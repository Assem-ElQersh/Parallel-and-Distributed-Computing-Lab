# Lab 7: OpenMP Parallelization Strategies for Algorithmic Patterns

## Problem Statement
Implement and analyze different parallelization strategies using OpenMP for common algorithmic patterns, focusing on:
1. Matrix multiplication
2. Performance comparison between sequential and parallel implementations
3. Analysis of speedup and efficiency with different thread counts

## Implementation Details

### Matrix Multiplication Implementation
- Matrix dimensions: 256x256
- Two implementations:
  1. Sequential version
  2. OpenMP parallel version with configurable thread count

### Key Components
1. Matrix Initialization
   - Random values between 1.0 and 10.0
   - Uses C++ random number generation

2. Sequential Implementation
   - Standard triple-nested loop structure
   - Time complexity: O(NÂ³)

3. Parallel Implementation
   - Uses OpenMP parallel for directive
   - Parallelizes the outermost loop
   - Configurable thread count

4. Verification
   - Compares results between sequential and parallel versions
   - Uses epsilon comparison for floating-point values

## Performance Analysis

### Test Configuration
- Matrix size: 256x256
- Thread counts tested: 2, 4, 8, 16
- Hardware: [Your CPU specifications]

### Results
| Thread Count | Execution Time (ms) | Speedup | Efficiency |
|--------------|-------------------|---------|------------|
| 1 (Sequential)| 14 | 1.0x | 100% |
| 2 | 9 | 1.56x | 78% |
| 4 | 6 | 2.33x | 58% |
| 8 | 3 | 4.67x | 58% |
| 16 | 4 | 3.50x | 22% |

### Analysis
1. Speedup Characteristics
   - Initial linear speedup with 2-4 threads
   - Diminishing returns with higher thread counts
   - Factors affecting performance:
     * Cache utilization
     * Memory bandwidth
     * Thread overhead

2. Efficiency Analysis
   - Best efficiency with 2-4 threads
   - Decreased efficiency with higher thread counts
   - Reasons for efficiency loss:
     * Thread management overhead
     * Memory contention
     * Cache coherency issues

3. Scalability
   - Strong scaling analysis
   - Limitations:
     * Memory bandwidth
     * Cache size
     * Thread synchronization overhead

## Conclusions
1. Performance Findings
   - Optimal thread count: 8 threads
   - Maximum achieved speedup: 4.67x
   - Best efficiency: 78% (with 2 threads)

2. Recommendations
   - Use 2-4 threads for best performance/efficiency balance
   - Consider matrix size when choosing thread count
   - Implement cache-friendly optimizations for better scaling

3. Future Improvements
   - Block-based multiplication
   - Cache-aware algorithms
   - SIMD optimizations
   - Hybrid OpenMP/MPI approach for larger matrices

## How to Run
1. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ -fopenmp code.cpp -o matrix_mult
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./matrix_mult
   ```

## Requirements
- C++ compiler with OpenMP support
- Minimum 4GB RAM recommended
- Multi-core processor

## Notes
- Results may vary based on hardware configuration
- Matrix size can be adjusted by modifying constants
- Thread count can be modified in the code
